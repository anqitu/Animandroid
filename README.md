## Animandroid

A simple Android application to deploy a keras model which can detect animals. There are currently 7 animals in the v1.2. If you want to build your own keras model or find out how to build a keras model for image categorization, you can go to my another repo [What-animal-are-you](https://github.com/anqitu/What-animal-are-you).

You can clone the repository to your laptop to build the apk on [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio/) or download the apk from the [APK folder](https://github.com/anqitu/Animandroid/tree/master/APK), then install on your phone to play.

The keras model deployed is built on pretraind [VGG16 keras model](https://github.com/keras-team/keras/blob/master/keras/applications/vgg16.py).
